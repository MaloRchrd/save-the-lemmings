## Synopsis

This is the first game I created as my first evaluation during my Fullstack Js training at Ifocop Paris.
We had to create a javascript game using no libraries.
At first I wanted to recreate the original "Lemmings" game (big fan of the game), but due to a lack of time I changed the rules, kept some of the design and animation to create "Save the Lemmings" :space_invader: :space_invader:.


## Presentation

Save the Lemmings is a basic game where Lemmings appear in the sky falling down
Your main goal is to catch them using the left :arrow_left: and right :arrow_right: arrows of the keyboard.

Demo : [save-the-lemmings](https://malorchrd.github.io/save-the-lemmings/)
